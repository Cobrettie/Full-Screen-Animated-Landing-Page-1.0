	<p>HTML uses special bits of programming language called
		"tags" to let the browser know how a webpage should look.
		The tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag to tell the
		browser when to start doing something, and an ending tag to
		tell the browser when to stop doing something. There are
		many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose.</p>

	<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript can be
		included in HTML code. CSS is used to change how a
		webpage looks. JavaScript is used to add features to
		webpages and make them more interactive.</p>

	<p>One of the aims of HTML5 is to remove the need to use
		third-party software like Adobe Flash, because it is often
		slow on mobile devices like phones and can be used to infect
		your computer with viruses. Another aim is to reduce the amount of
		program code (JavaScript) running in each webpage, thus
		making the web faster.</p>

	<p>
		HyperText Markup Language was first proposed by the famed
		inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee.
		He built this simple markup language based on SGMLguid, the standard
		documentation format used internally at CERN. The first publicly
		available description of the language only contained 18 elements,
		all of them inspired by SGMLguid with the exception of the hyperlink tag.
	</p>

	<p>HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
		There are many versions of HTML. The current standard is
		HTML 4.01. So, it is the version the W3C recommends. A
		newer version, called HTML5, will become standard within
		the next few years. The W3C also develops XHTML. This is
		another markup language which is very similar to HTML,
		but more strict.</p>

		<p>
			HTML5 was the first major overhaul of the HTML specification
			since the release of HTML 4.01 in 1999 - at long last, as
			many would say. And it was one that brought serious changes
			in the way markup was rendered by web browsers, changes that
			were long overdue. Among others, it has added a way to
			natively handle multimedia and graphical content, and it has
			added new page structure elements in order to enhance the s
			emantic content of documents.
			<br>
			<br>
			HTML 5.0 became a Recommendation in 2014, HTML 5.1 "suffered"
			the same fate in 2016, and HTML 5.2 was released as a W3C
			Recommendation on December 14, 2017. And this is where we stand today.
